* Notes from the email they sent
AUDIO: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gJcxvAqft4Fme9FM4NREPKekopLJ0TZr?usp=sharing

NOTES:

1.Untethered (into techno track, quite abrasive) maybe good to bpm match visuals to josh’s synth rhythm


——transition into next song———


2.Divine Intervention (more fun and disco vibes) brighter geometrical caribou vibes? Pinks and blues


3.Talks (more fun and disco vibes) similar to before with some transitionary elements - more reds and blues?


4.Comfort Eating (more fun and disco vibes) combo of reds pinks blues from talks and divine to round off the disco punk part of set

5.Project Bunker (ending goes crazy) introduction of clubs harsher vibes / strobes / monochrome / still geometric with more glitchy elements introduced

6.Soap (potentially a bit darker at the beginning then opens out to be more expansive) purples whites - ethereal vibe but abrasive

7.Sleek Form (ending goes crazy) precipice of abrasive club strobe vibes


8.Exhaust/Surroundings (middle bit goes crazy into euphoric ending) the ending / climax / combination of darkness and light / abrasive and eurphoric / brooding at beginning - glitchy at middle opening up to eurphoric ending

* Notes before the meeting with Josh and Darius
** Can't MIDI sync but can use the audio frequencies as an input. I do all the syncing manually by hand
** Qualify what they mean about strobes
** Ask about 3D models
*** Do they have any they want to use?
*** Do they want me to make some?
** Find out whether video is going to be feasible
** Find out about
** Find out what they want in between songs without an audible transition (fade to black, fade to logo, a visual transition?)
** Find out what they want to do with logo
*** Ask for the model off Josh
** Talk about payment
*** 100 for the FP live show, more for the fabric one and then if they want some touring visuals that'll be another discussion.
** Find out about projector
*** If the want it projected behind them then maybe a short throw if there's nowhere to mount it.
*** May need to pop over to the venue to look at options for mounting it.

* Notes after meeting with Josh and Darius
** audio interface
** Use the logo from josh
** Make sure I can make simple adjustments on the fly
** Find out about when I finish work
** Buy a hdmi for the camera
